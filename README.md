# GPTGTA

**GPTGTA** is a playable, browser-based, top-down GTA-style sandbox prototype built through an AI-first / GPT-native development workflow.

Live site: **https://gptgta.com**

This repository preserves the public development line from **V1 through V4.2**, including playable HTML builds, version screenshots, patch notes, release timeline, AI documentation, and the shared asset structure.

## What this is

GPTGTA is an independent browser prototype exploring how large language models can assist with game creation through prompt-driven iteration, code generation, debugging, balancing, asset organization, documentation, and public deployment.

It is **not a GTA mod** and does not use official GTA assets. It is an independent retro top-down browser sandbox inspired by early open-world crime-game design language.

## Play

Current public build: **https://gptgta.com**

Local version files are stored in:

```text
/versions/v1
/versions/v2
/versions/v3
/versions/v3.1
/versions/v4
/versions/v4.2
```

Open the relevant HTML file in a browser, or serve the repository locally if a browser blocks local asset loading.

## AI-first development method

GPTGTA was developed through continuous human-directed prompting and AI-assisted implementation. GPT was used as a development partner for:

- gameplay system design
- JavaScript and HTML generation
- mobile control design
- performance debugging
- version comparison
- asset-path restructuring
- public documentation
- release packaging

The project is preserved as an early public example of prompt-driven browser game development.
